# Multinomial Logistic Regression for Ordinal Response Variable

## Introduction  

This project employs **multinomial logistic regression** to analyze a vehicle dataset, focusing on how different attributes impact safety ratings, treated as an ordinal response variable. The analysis investigates the relationships between various categorical dependent variables and multiple independent variables, offering insights into the influence of car features such as **buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, vehicle capacity**, and **luggage boot size** on safety classifications ranging from low to high.

## Key Insights  
- **Higher buying price** and **maintenance cost** are associated with better safety ratings, likely due to the inclusion of advanced safety technologies and higher-quality materials in costlier vehicles.
- **Vehicle capacity** (number of passengers) is a critical factor, with larger vehicles receiving higher safety ratings, indicating stricter safety standards for cars carrying more passengers.
- **Number of doors** and **luggage boot size** have a minimal impact on safety ratings, suggesting these features do not significantly influence overall safety performance.

## Methodology  
The multinomial logistic regression model is built using the **Newton-Raphson optimization technique** to maximize the likelihood function, ensuring precise estimates of how each vehicle feature affects the probability of receiving a certain safety rating.

## Application & Implications  
- **Manufacturers** can use these findings to prioritize features that enhance safety, meeting consumer expectations and regulatory requirements.
- **Consumers** gain a deeper understanding of which attributes most significantly impact safety, aiding in more informed vehicle purchases.
- Insights can also guide **policy-makers** in shaping safety regulations in the automotive industry.

This analysis demonstrates the value of multinomial logistic regression in understanding ordinal data and highlights its practical applications in the field of vehicle safety evaluation.

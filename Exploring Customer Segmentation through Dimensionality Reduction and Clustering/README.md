# Exploring Customer Segmentation through Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering: A Comparative Analysis with KMeans, Hierarchical (Agglomerative), and DBSCAN in Python  

## Objective
The project aims to conduct unsupervised clustering on customer data from a grocery firm's database to achieve customer segmentation. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behaviors and similarities, enabling the business to design targeted products and marketing strategies for each segment. This customer segmentation helps optimize business operations by addressing the unique needs and preferences of different customer groups, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement.

## Key Contributions
- Applied dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to streamline the data for efficient analysis.
- Performed comparative analysis using K-Means, Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms to identify optimal customer clusters.
- Evaluated the performance of each algorithm based on clustering quality metrics such as silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.
- Visualized the clusters and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide business insights.
- Provided actionable recommendations on product development and personalized marketing strategies based on the segmentation results.

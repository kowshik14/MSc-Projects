# EDA & Classification Report on Boston Housing Data  

## Objective  
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building classification models on the Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to explore the data, understand feature relationships, and classify whether a house’s median value is above or below the dataset’s median using various machine learning algorithms.

## Key Contributions  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Conducted **univariate analysis** to examine the distribution of individual features.
  - Performed **bi-variate analysis** to explore relationships between variables, particularly with the target variable.
  - Analyzed the **covariance matrix** to understand correlations among features.
  - Visualized **pair plots** to identify patterns and interactions between variables.
  
- **Classification Models:**  
  Implemented multiple classification models, including **Random Forest (RF)**, **Decision Tree (DT)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Logistic Regression (LR)** to predict housing price categories (above or below median value).

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Used evaluation metrics derived from the confusion matrix, including **accuracy**, **predicted positive/negative values**, **sensitivity (recall)**, **specificity**, and the **ROC curve** to assess model performance. **Random Forest** outperformed other models in terms of overall accuracy and ROC-AUC score.

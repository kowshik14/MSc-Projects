# AnimeLens: A Hybrid Approach for Personalized Anime Recommendations using Deep Collaborative Filtering and TF-IDF Content Based Filtering

## Abstract  
In the age of abundant digital content, recommendation systems are pivotal in helping users navigate vast collections of information by suggesting personalized content. This project introduces **AnimeLens**, a hybrid anime recommendation system that combines **deep collaborative filtering** and **TF-IDF content-based filtering** to provide tailored suggestions for anime enthusiasts. AnimeLens is designed to address the unique characteristics of the anime domain, offering users personalized recommendations based on their viewing history, preferences, and engagement data. By leveraging collaborative filtering, which focuses on user similarity and behavior, and content-based filtering, which analyzes the features of anime titles, the system ensures accurate and diverse suggestions that reflect both user preferences and anime content attributes.

The hybrid approach of AnimeLens enhances recommendation quality by overcoming the limitations of individual methods—such as sparse data or the cold-start problem—providing well-rounded suggestions. Through the use of machine learning algorithms and user engagement data, the system adapts to evolving tastes and preferences. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid model, offering higher accuracy and satisfaction compared to standalone recommendation algorithms. AnimeLens aims to enrich the anime viewing experience, foster content discovery, and provide a practical framework for future advancements in personalized recommendation systems in the anime entertainment industry.
